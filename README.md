# Whiteboard probe device
This repository contains the Arduino code for using the wall plotter device.
Python code for sending repeated commands is also included.

Two arduino files are included:
- arduinoUser: flash this to the arduino for sending single commands
- arduinoPython: flash this when using the device with the python program included

Make sure to close the Arduino IDE serial window when using the Python program.
